# Travel Challenge

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

In this challenge we’d like you to build a basic flight options UI (example below) using a mock
server we have deployed to return a sample flight(s) response.
Minimum Requirements:

- Your UI should display this information at a minimum (per option):
- Airline Name(s)
- Destination & Origin Airport(s)
- Departure and Arrival Times
- Stopover Information (number of stops if the flight is not direct)
- We’d like you to use Vue 3 (specifically the composition API)
